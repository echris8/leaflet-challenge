Please find my Challenge 15, leaflet-challenge. 

In this challenge, I was tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. 

A classmate shared this source for doing the Leaflet legend with me, and I adapted it to my code.
